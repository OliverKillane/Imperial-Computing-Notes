# 50003 - Models of Computation

## [Course Notes](50003%20-%20Models%20of%20Computation.pdf)
## Module Description
[From the college website...](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/50003/)

This module focuses on formal descriptions (models) of computational behaviour. You will learn about:

- the operational semantics (formal description)  of a simple 'WHILE' programming language
- the operational semantics of other styles of real-world languages, such as Java and Haskell
- equivalent  definitions of algorithm, initiated in the 1930s and providing the foundations for programming languages and computation

Upon successful competition of this module a student will be able to:
- provide formal descriptions of the precise behaviour of several styles of programming language
- prove properties of such languages
- provide several formal definitions of algorithm
- link the definition of algorithm with the fundamental notion of a computable function
