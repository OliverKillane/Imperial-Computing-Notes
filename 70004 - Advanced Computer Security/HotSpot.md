## Definition
The *Java HotSpot Performance Engine* is a [[Java Virtual Machine]] implemented by Sun, then taken over by oracle and finally open sourced under [[OpenJDK]].

Its name is derived from analysing program behaviour to identify frequently executed code (hot spots) to JIT compiler.

It was the default sun [[Java Virtual Machine]] from `java 1.3` onwards.
