## Description
### CVE-2013-2471
Factories are used to create a raster object verified through a `verify()` method. By overriding a `getNumDataElements` method to return `0` the checks can be avoided, and thus malicious raster objects (which `blit`/change pixel values maliciously to corrupt memory) can be returned and run.
### CVE-2013-2465
```java
public final BufferedImage filter (BufferedImage src, BufferedImage dst)
```
Each `BufferedImage` contains `hintP->dataOffset hint->numChans` which contains values for the `ColorModel` and `SampleModel` members of the `BufferedImage`
- Because the size of the hint is assumed to always be kept the same as the `ColorModel`/`SampleModel` no bounds checks are performed, meaning a maliciously overriden hint can escape the buffer and corrupt heap memory
### CVE-2012-4681
`com.sun.beans.finder.MethodFinder` contains insufficient permissions checks which allow users to get method objects from restricted packages such as `sun.awt.SUN.Toolkit`.
