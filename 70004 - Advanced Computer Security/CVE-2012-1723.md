## [NVD - CVE-2012-1723 (nist.gov)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2012-1723)
## Description
A bug in [[HotSpot]]'s bytecode verifier that resulted in an invalid optimisation when bytecode verification is applied to deferred field access instructions (i.e. `GETSTATIC`, `PUTSTATIC`, `GETFIELD`, `PUTFIELD`).
## Exploit
See full description at [here](https://schierlm.users.sourceforge.net/CVE-2012-1723.html).
```java

class Myclass {
    int member;
    
	void dothing(bool cont) {
		if (!cont) {
			return;
		}
		member += 2; // requires two accessses to the same member
		member += 1;
	}
}
```
- The verification of the instructions is deferred until they need to be executed.
- By calling the method with `cont = false` many times, the method is JIT compiled, but as we never hit `member` the two access instructions are never verified
- On the next call with `cont = true` the partially-unverified JIT compiled version is called.
