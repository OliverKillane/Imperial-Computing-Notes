## Main Challenges

| Challenge            | Description                                                                                                                                                          |

| LAN Mistrust         | Where IoT devices that rely on local network based authentication                                                                                                    |
| Environment Mistrust | When the IoT device trusts the physical environment (e.g. trust a camera is not moved, or for voice assistants that the voice speaking physically nearby is allowed) |
| App Over-Privilege   | Where apps can perform unauthorized/unexpected actions on multi-app platforms (e.g. )                                                                                |
| Weak Athentication   | For example speakers that allow anyone with bluetooth in range to connected.                                                                                         |
| Implementation Flaws | Hardcoded credentials, [[Cross Site Scripting\|XSS]], open ports and debugging functionality, unencrypted transmission                                               |
