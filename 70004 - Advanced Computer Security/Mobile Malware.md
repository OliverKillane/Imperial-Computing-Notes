## Malware Families

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| FakeApps | Seemingly benign software masquerading as a legitimate app (e.g. SMS) generating revenue through ads. |
| AdWare | Not originally recognised as malware. Collects user data without consent. |
| RiskTool | In-app purchases without user's consent, can send to premium SMS numbers to slowly drain user credit. |
| Trojan Droppers | Acts as a malware installer, other criminals pay the dropper to install their applications. |
| Trojan SMS | Intercept SMS and incoming calls (spyware). |
| Trojan Banker | Gain access to credit card information. |
Repackaged applications are common. For example early versions of angry birds being taken, decompiled by hackers and repackaged with malware that sends to messages to premium numbers. 
### GingerBreak
A root exploit in a repackaged angry birds game, that installed additional malware and added the device to a botnet.
### Skype Privacy Leak
Skype's persisted files (including voicemails) were left with very loose permissions on the file system, allowing any other process on the android device to read or write.
- Originally put blame on users (don't have malware on your device)
- Pushed a fix that included tightening permissions
