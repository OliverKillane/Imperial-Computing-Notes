> The **YubiKey** is a hardware [authentication device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token "Security token") manufactured by **Yubico** to protect access to computers, networks, and online services that supports [one-time passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password "One-time password") (OTP), [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography"), and authentication, and the [Universal 2nd Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor "Universal 2nd Factor") (U2F) and [FIDO2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO2_Project "FIDO2 Project") protocols developed by the [FIDO Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO_Alliance "FIDO Alliance"). It allows users to securely log into their accounts by emitting one-time passwords or using a FIDO-based public/private key pair generated by the device. YubiKey also allows storing [static passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_password "Static password") for use at sites that do not support one-time passwords. Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook use YubiKey devices to secure employee accounts as well as end-user accounts.
