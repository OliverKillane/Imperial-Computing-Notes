## Summary
A heap buffer-overflow vulnerability in the *perl compatible regular expressions library* (*PCRE*) in the javascript engine used by apple's WebKit (part of Safari).

Allows arbitrary code to be run with administrative privileges.
- Reading SMS log, address book, call history
- Can transmit data back to attackers
- Can access device functionality for systems sound/vibrate, dialling numbers and sending messages, recording audio.
## Discovery
WebKit is open source, by using code coverage on the `JavaScriptCore` it was found only 54.7% of PCRE was covered, versus 79.3% for the main engine.
1. Created a PCRE fuzzer
2. The fuzzer was run against instrumented code, showing buffer overflows
3. Evil regular expressions created to take cause these overflows
The overflows could then be used to exploit.
