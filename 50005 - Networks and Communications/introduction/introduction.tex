\section{What is Computer Networking?}
\begin{definitionbox}{Computer Networking}
    The process of interconnecting computer systems via telecommunications methods to share data and resources.
\end{definitionbox}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Networks are becoming pervasive (everywhere, always on).
    \item Most mainstream software systems are distributed (cloud computing).
    \item Peformance often depends on network usage (can be a bottleneck or on critical path).
\end{itemize}

\begin{sidenotebox}{First Internet Connection}
    Arpanet (first part of the internet) was created on september 1st 1969 with a single node.
    \\
    \\ First message as "login", after "lo" was transmitted it crashed, but sent the result after rebooting an hour later.
    \\
    \\ Greatly expanded afterwords, connecting several universities.
