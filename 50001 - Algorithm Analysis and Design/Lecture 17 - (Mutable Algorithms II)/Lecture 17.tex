\section*{Mutable Nub}
This can be useful for the \fun{nub} function (removes duplicates from a list) by using a bucket based hashmap of items from the list to determine duplication.
\codelist{Haskell}{nub.hs}

\section*{Quicksort}
We can also implement quicksort, which can be done in place in an array
(saved memory and time as accesses are constant time).
\\
\\ By using mutable data structures we can swap elements when reordering by reading and writing from the array.
