# 50001 - Algorithm Analysis and Design

## UNFINISHED & LOW PRIORITY
These notes are planned upgrades of those in the second year notes repo, but due to the quality of already existing official course notes they are low priority.

## Module Description
[From the college website...](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/50001/)

In this module you will have the opportunity to:
- Explore the main algorithmic design paradigms
- Apply algorithmic techniques to practical and unseen problems
- Quantitatively analyse the performance of algorithms
- Model the mathematical structure of computational tasks and apply the right algorithmic tools on them
- Develop your algorithmic thinking and problem solving skills.

The module syllabus includes:
- Quantitative Analysis of Algorithms and Growth Order
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Randomised Algorithms
- Advanced Graph Algorithms
- String Processing Algorithms
