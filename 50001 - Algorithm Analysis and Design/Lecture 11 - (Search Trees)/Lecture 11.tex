\section*{Equality}
\codelist{Haskell}{equality.hs}
Eq is the typeclass for equality, any instance of this class should ensure the equality satisfied the laws:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{r l}
		reflexivity  & $x == x$                                 \\
		transitivity & $x == y \land y == z \Rightarrow x == z$ \\
		symmetry     & $x == y \Rightarrow y == x$              \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We also expect the idescernability of identicals (Leibniz Law):
\[x == y \Rightarrow f \ x == f \ y\]
For a set-like interface we have a member function:
\codelist{Haskell}{member.hs}
If we assume only that Eq holds, the complexity is $O(n)$ as we must potentially check all members of the set. To get around this, we use ordering.

\section*{Orderings}
The Ord typeclass allows us to check for inequalities:
\codelist{Haskell}{order.hs}
We must try to ensure certain properties hold, for example for to have a partial order we require:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{r l}
		reflexivity  & $x \leq x$                                     \\
		transitivity & $x \leq y \land y \leq z \Rightarrow x \leq z$ \\
		antisymmetry & $x \leq y \land y \leq x \Rightarrow x == y$   \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
There are also total orders (all elements in the set are ordered compared to all others), for which we add the constraint:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{r l}
		connexity & $x \leq y \lor y \leq x$ \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section*{Ordered Sets}
\codelist{Haskell}{ordset.hs}
We can implement this class for Trees:
\codelist{Haskell}{search tree.hs}
However the worst case here is still $O(n)$ as we do not balance the tree as more members are inserted. If the members are added in order, the tree devolves to a linked list.
\\
\\ We need a way to create a tree that self balances.

\section*{Binary Search Trees (AVL Trees)}
\codelist{Haskell}{avl tree.hs}
When inserting into the tree we must keep the tree balanced such that no subtree's left is more than one higher than its' right.
\codelist{Haskell}{avl tree insert.hs}
We must rebalance the tree after insertion, this must consider the following cases:
\centerimage{width=\textwidth}{htree balanced.png}
When the tree's balanced invariant has been broken, we must follow these cases:
\centerimage{width=\textwidth}{htree rotate right.png}
\codelist{Haskell}{avl rotate right.hs}
When the right subtree's right subtree is higher:
\centerimage{width=\textwidth}{htree rotate left.png}
\codelist{Haskell}{avl rotate left.hs}
We can use rotate left and rotate right to for the two cases where the right subtree is 2 or more higher than the left.
\codelist{Haskell}{avl balance.hs}
