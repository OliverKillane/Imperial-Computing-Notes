## Definition
To get more precise [[Control Flow Analysis]] that can distinguish between different instances of a function call we can introduce the ability to distinguish between instances of variables & labels to get control flow related to a specific use of a function.
- Called polyvariant analysis
Some such analyses include:
- k-CFA analyses
- uniform k-CFA analyses
- polynomial k-CFA analyses
- Cartesian Product Algorithm
