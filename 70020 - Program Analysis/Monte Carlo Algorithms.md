## Definition
Algorithms with deterministic running time, that produce an output which is correct with some error bound.
## Examples
### Buffon's Needle
Given a space made of parallel strips (width $t$) and a line of some fixed length $l$. What is the probability the needle crosses the boundary between two strips.
$$p(cross) = \cfrac{2}{\pi} \times \cfrac{l}{t}$$
- Earliest known geometric probability problem to be solved.
- Can be used to estimate $\pi$ (get $p(cross)$ experimentally, solve for $\pi$)
