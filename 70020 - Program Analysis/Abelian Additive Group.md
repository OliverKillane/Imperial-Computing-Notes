## Definition
An *Abelian Group* is a commutative [[Group]]. An *Additive Group* is a [[Group]] with a $\bullet$ that is analogous/should be thought of as additive in some way. 
- (*Abelian Group*) For a group $G$ $\forall a, b \in G : a \bullet b = b \bullet a$
- (*Additive Group*) We can write $\bullet$ as $+$ instead

## Examples
