Given some set of symbols $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$ we can get power sets (the sets of all combinations of some number of the elements).
$$X = \{1,2,3\} \ \ \ \mathcal{P}(X) = \{\emptyset, \{1\},\{2\},\{3\},\{1,2\},\{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,3\},\{1,2,3\}\}$$
- Size of $|\mathcal{P}(X)|=2^{|X|}$
## Examples
### Basic Powerset
The maximum number of subsets a subset is included in within the height of $\mathcal{P}(\{x,y,z\})$.
- We can just use the $\emptyset$ in which case it is $2^3 = 8$. 
- If we restrict to chain length, it is $3$.
