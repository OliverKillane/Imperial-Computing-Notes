## What is this repo?

This repo is the collection of notes for my chosen third year modules (taught 2022-23) and some second year modules (taught 2021-22).

It is designed as an improvement in quality over the [second year repo](https://github.com/OliverKillane/Imperial-Computing-Year-2-Notes).
