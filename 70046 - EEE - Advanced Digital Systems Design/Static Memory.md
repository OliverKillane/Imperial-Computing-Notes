## Definition
Uses transistors, typically two latches.
- Lack of leakage (as with [[Dynamic Memory#1T DRAM]]) means low power consumption & no refresh required.
## 6T SRAM
A common 6-[[Transistor]] SRAM design.

## Access
Both read & write are asynchronous.
- A *WE* (write enable) and *OE* (output enable) control output and
