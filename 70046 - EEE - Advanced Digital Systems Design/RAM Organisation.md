## Memory Array Structure
![[basic_memory_array.drawio.svg]]
Generally we attempt to make the memory array as *square* as possible (word-lines $\approx$ bit-lines) to reduce [[Parasitic Capacitance]] of both groups of lines.
- This only allows for a single address & data bus supporting a single read/write port.
## MultiPort Memory
Increasing bandwidth of read with multiple read ports.
