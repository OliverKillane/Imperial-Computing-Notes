Undefined behaviour is the result of executing code with behaviour not described by the language spec (or standard).
- Many [[Generic Bugs]] are instances of [[Undefined Behaviour]]
## Examples
### C Programming Language
Buffer overflows, null-pointer dereference, division/modulo zero, uninitialized reads, shifting a negative number.
