## Module Description

[From the college website...](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/50008/)
In this module you will have the opportunity to:

- use probability theory to model uncertainty
- design simple probabilistic models that facilitate prediction
- conduct sound scientific analysis of data
- use Bayesian inference to refine hypotheses

This module covers the following topics:

- Foundations of probability based on measurable sets
- Discrete random variables and their probability distributions
- Poisson processes
- Continuous random variables and their probability distributions
- Central Limit Theorem
- Generating functions
- Joint random variables
- Estimation
- Hypothesis Testing
- Bayesian inference
- Markov chains
## Lecturers
Probability (First Half): Professor Giuliano Casale  Statistics (Second Half): Professor Chiraag Lala.
