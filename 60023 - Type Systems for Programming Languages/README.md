# 60023 - Type Systems for programming Languages
## Module Description
[From the college website...](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/60023/)

In this module you will study in detail the design of type assignment systems for programming languages and focus on the importance of a sound theoretical framework, in order to be able to reason about the properties of a typed program. You will also study and compare the types systems of various modern functional and object-oriented programming languages.

- Review of Lambda calculus
