## Definition
A NoSQL database storing data as JSON documents.
- some [[XML]] databases may also count, but are not modern/part of the more recent noSQL trend.

- SQL requires a schema, not flexible
- oldSQL is not scalable (though newer redesigns are)
- SQL requires lots of joins, often unintuitive
