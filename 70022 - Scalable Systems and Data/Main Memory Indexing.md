## Definition
Storing indexes in main memory to speed up access.

Consider:
- CPU speed increasing faster than memory access latency is decreasing.
- memory capacity is increasing quickly.
Hence now many databases can fit entirely in memory, and memory access is the new bottleneck. [[Non Uniform Access Model]] & cache performance are critical.
